# NBA Player Search React

This is a search app for NBA players.  You can enter a player name and search for their statistics.  In the picture below a search for "Curry" gives the following results.

For player profile images, this API was used: [https://github.com/iNaesu/nba-headshot-api](https://github.com/iNaesu/nba-headshot-api).  In the above picture only Stephen Curry and brother Seth Curry have photos available.  As you can see many older player images are not available on this API.  A generic default picture is shown if the player's photo is unavailable in the headshot API.

The headshot API was last updated for the 2017-2018 season, so some player images will not be current.  For example Lebron James is pictured in a Cleveland Cavaliers uniform (2017), but as of now (2022) he is a member of the LA Lakers.

Player stats are all taken from the balldontlie API.

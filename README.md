# NBA Player Search React

This is a search app for NBA players.  The API comes from [https://www.balldontlie.io/](https://www.balldontlie.io/).  It contains player and team information from 1979 to the current season.

For player profile images, this API was used: [https://github.com/iNaesu/nba-headshot-api](https://github.com/iNaesu/nba-headshot-api).  However this was last updated for the 2017-2018 season, so some player images will not be current.  


For example Lebron James is pictured in a Cleveland Cavaliers uniform (2017), but as of now (2022) he is a member of the LA Lakers.
